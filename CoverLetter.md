Hello Morris,

I am writing to express my interest in the Lead role at Rio Tinto. With a proven track record in technical leadership and a passion for building high-performing products, I believe my experience will align with the requirements of this position.

### **Mentorship**
My approach to leadership centers on effective mentorship. While at Schlumberger, I directly supervised and guided team members like Deobrat Singh and Shalini Bhandare to successfully deliver the Data Ops screen for Shape and ZGY File ingestion workflows. I made them proficient in Angular, RxJS, and state management concepts, enabling them to work independently on complex technical challenges.

My technical expertise spans multiple areas critical to modern application development. As an Angular/React Developer with over a decade of experience, I've worked extensively with various versions, developing applications for various clients and platforms, including a large commercial bank and a major oil and gas provider.

I've also demonstrated strong expertise in React development, having worked with versions 17 and 18.x for oil and gas clients. I've created reusable UI components and contributed to Storybook projects, developing components capable of handling significant data loads without performance lags. For example, I created an Org chart React component that could support 1000-2000 leaf nodes while maintaining optimal performance.

### **Solutions Experience**
I developed a proxy middleware within a NestJS application for the DM Portal that intercepts incoming requests and forwards them to appropriate target service URLs. This solution maintains anonymity when communicating with downstream systems while preserving sensitive information like SAuth Client ID and API keys. The middleware was designed to be flexible and scalable, with the ability to incorporate features like caching in the future.

### **Input to Business**
As a Front-End SME, I provided significant input to business by working on estimations for Request for Proposals (RFPs). I collaborated closely with Solution Architects to produce coherent technical proposals that met customer requirements, architected software solutions for various problem types, and performed competitive analysis and vendor selection processes.

I also led the Advanced Angular Training program to help various projects scale up their existing developers' skills. I redesigned and evaluated Angular courses covering topics from basic concepts to advanced techniques like HTTPClient, RxJS, Advanced TypeScript, Routing, and SOLID principles.

### **Professional Visibility**
I provided technology solutions focused on structuring, managing, and implementing complex solutions. I have modernized systems, leveraging emerging technologies important to clients such as Progressive Web Apps, accessibility testing, and emerging architecture patterns.

I also participated in a Design Thinking workshop with an oil and gas client, where I proposed a Voice controlled UI interface. My contributions led to the incorporation of two major features in their product roadmap: a geofencing feature and voice-controlled UI for web applications. My expertise in this area led to recognition as a developer for both Web and KIOSK, with appreciation shared by oil and gas clients.

With my technical expertise, proven mentorship abilities, I am confident I can make a significant contribution to your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to speaking with you soon.

Sincerely,
Ankit Tanna
