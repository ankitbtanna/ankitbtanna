<p style="font-weight:400;font-size:20px">Iâ€™m a motivated individual with 11+ years of experience in Frontend/NodeJS application development. I have worked in several domains like Banking, Oil and Gas, eLearning, eCommerce, etc. I have played roles like developer, scrum master, trainer, and product evangelist for in-house design frameworks. I like to be familiar with design patterns and features of core programming languages helping me solve daily problems. I run a YouTube channel called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@EverydayJavaScript/">EverydayJavaScript</a>, where I teach features about Web Technologies.</p>
